There will be different balls in the arena, which will have a hole in the center. Each ball will have some points. Participants will try to get as many balls as they can, using their robots while their opponents try the same. Teams can drop their opponents’ balls in the hole in order to prevent them from scoring those points. The competitors can also knock out their opponents by knocking them into the hole twice.">
